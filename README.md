This thesis provides a theoretical study of statistical properties of some neural network models by means of random matrix theory and models selection tools. We discuss the concentration inequalities approach, established in Louart, Liao and Couillet (2018). Some limiting spectral results of certain matrices, presented in Pennington and Worah (2017) and Benigni y Péché (2019), are studied, as well as a novel application of an information criterion approach to select a hyperparameter. Moreover, some original and applicable results about new and useful activation functions are presented, as well as conjectures related to training speed in deep neural networks.

This repository has the code made for the practical outcomes in Chapter 4 (Models Selection Aplications to Extreme Learning Machines) and Chapter 5 (Training Speed in Multilayer Neural Networks).
